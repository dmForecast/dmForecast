# dmForecast

dmForecast is a tool for forecasting uncertainties on properties of dwarf Galaxy Dark Matter halos (e.g shape of the density profile or enclosed mass)that is attainable through jeans modeling.

Example usage provided in example.ipynb
With this tool you can explore how errors scale with the number of stars you observe, and the accuracy of your observations:
